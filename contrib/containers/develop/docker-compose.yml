# A note about volumes:
#
# If Docker is interacting with your operating system directly
# without an intermediate VM, then you do not need to change anything
#
# But if not, then you'll need to mount your system's root directory
# (i.e. /) into the boot2docker instance if you want to mirror the exact
# filesystem structure of your host.
#
    volumes:
      - type: bind
#        source: /host/$PWD # Workaround needed on non-Linux hosts
